            <p><strong>Batminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
                    Although it
                    may be
                    played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per
                    side)
                    and
                    "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in
                    a
                    yard
                    or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by
                    striking
                    the
                    shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.

                    Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
                    shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or
                    (in
                    their absence) the opposing side.[1]

                    The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies
                    differently
                    from
                    the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag,
                    causing
                    the
                    shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the
                    balls in
                    other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive
                    nature</strong>
